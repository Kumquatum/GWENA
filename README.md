# GWENA

## Overview
**GWENA** (Gene Whole co-Expression Network Analysis) is an R package to perform gene co-expression network analysis in a single pipeline. This pipeline includes functional enrichment of modules of co-expressed genes, phenotypcal association, topological analysis and comparisons of networks between conditions.

Using transcriptomics data from either RNA-seq  or microarray, the package follows the steps displayed in Figure 1:

1. **Input**: data is provided as a data.frame or a matrix of expression intensities (pre-normalized).
2. **Gene filtering**: data is filtered according to the transcriptomic technology used.
3. **Network building**: a matrix of similarity score is computed between each gene with Spearman correlation, then transformed into an adjacency matrix, and finally into a topological overlap matrix.
4. **Modules detection**: groups of genes with closest similarity scores are detected as modules.
5. **Biological integration**: gene set enrichment analysis and phenotypic association (if phenotypes are provided) are performed on modules.
6. **Graph and topological analysis**: identification of hub genes is made available, as well as modules visualization.
7. **Networks comparison**: if multiple conditions are available (time points, treatments, phenotype, etc.), analysis of modules preservation/non-preservation between conditions can be performed.


## Installation
```R
# Prerequisites
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly=TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
```

Installation can either be from:

1. ~~the official version of the last Bioconductor release (recommended).~~ Not yet available
```R
# BiocManager::install("GWENA") # Not yet available
```
2. the last stable version from the Bioc Devel branch.
```R
# 2. From Bioconductor devel
BiocManager::install("GWENA", version = "devel")
```
3. the day-to-day development version from the [Github repository](https://github.com/Kumquatum/GWENA).
```R
# 3. From Github repository
BiocManager::install("Kumquatum/GWENA")
# OR
devtools::install_github("Kumquatum/GWENA")
```
