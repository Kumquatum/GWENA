Description: Analyse transcriptomics data (either microarray or RNA-seq) through co-expression prism. 
    Meaning data pre-processing and built of modules based on expression intensities. Then add multiple
    biological information (functional enrichment, topological analysis, differential co-expression, 
    network visualisation, differential expression, etc.9) in order to draw a full picture of the context.
