\usage{
net_building(data_expr, cor_func = c("pearson", "spearman", "bicor",
  "other"), your_func = NULL, power_value = NULL, fit_cut_off = 0.9,
  network_type = c("unsigned", "signed", "signed hybrid", "none"),

  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_expr}{matrix of expression data with genes as column and samples as row.}

\item{cor_func}{string specifying correlation function to be used. Must be one of pearson, spearman, bicor.
TODO finish}

\item{power_value}{soft-thresolding, meaning power which will be applied to the adjacency matrix.}

\item{power_cut_off}{if no power provided, computes power and thresold it by this value.}

\value{
list containing
}
\description{
Compute the adjacency matrix, then the TOM to build the network. Than detect the modules by hierarchical clustering and thresholding

\item{which should have been adequatly normalized and filtered if pertinant. ATTENTION : it is not recommended to filter by differential
 expression (cf. \link(https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html)}.
Warning : saving adjacency increase the final return size. Working withtom is usually suffisant since it's the only value used for the
next step \code{\link{modules_detection}}.
