\title{Filtering of low counts}
\usage{
filter_RNA_seq(data_expr, min_count = 5, method = c("at least one",
  "mean", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data_expr}{matrix or data.frame or SummarizedExperiment, table of expression values (either microarray or RNA-seq),
with genes as column and samples as row.}

\item{min_count}{integer, minimal number of count to be considered in method.}

\item{method}{string, name of the method for filtering. Must be one of "at least one", "mean", or " all"}
}
\value{
A data.frame of filtered genes
}
\description{
Keeping genes with at least one sample with count above min_count in RNA-seq data.
}
\details{
Low counts in RNA-seq can bring noise to gene co-expression module building, so filtering them
help to improve quality.
}
\examples{
df <- matrix(abs(rnorm(15*45)), 15) * 3
colnames(df) <- paste0("gene_", 1:ncol(df))
rownames(df) <- paste0("sample_", 1:nrow(df))
df_filtered <- filter_RNA_seq(df)
